Python script to save the interview experiences of a specific company from geekforgeeks in pdf format.

install dependencies-
pdfkit, requests, BeautifulSoup

To run the script,
example - python3 snapdeal

This creates a folder named 'snapdeal' in the directory where the script is placed and 
the pdf's are downloaded in that folder.

TODO-
It sometimes doesent fetch all the experiences of companies which have more than 1 page 
of links.
